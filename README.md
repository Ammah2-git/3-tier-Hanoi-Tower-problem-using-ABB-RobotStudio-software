Our group had been given a task to solve a 3-tier 
Hanoi Tower problem using ABB RobotStudio® 
software. In the Hanoi Tower problem, a stack of 3 
blocks labelled with number 1, 2 and 3 on each block 
will be rearranged at another predefined area 
according to a planned sequence. The goal is to 
determine the shortest running time of the given task 
under nominal operating speed of the robot. 
The Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical 
puzzle or game made up of three blocks, each of 
which has a unique number. For example, block 1, 
block 2, and block 3 are all distinct numbers. The 
blocks are arranged in decreasing numerical order 
on one section, with the smallest at the top. There 
are three sections in total, two of which were 
emptied at the start of the game. The purpose of the 
task is to move the stacks of the 3 blocks to another 
section while following the rules below: 
1. Only one block may be moved at a time.
2. Each move consists of taking the upper 
block from one of the stacks and placing it 
on top of another stack or on an empty 
section.
3. No block may be placed on top of a block 
that is smaller than it.
By programming the ABB RobotStudio® software 
to move the blocks using planned trajectory motion, 
this problem can be solved. 
In this project we will be able to understand 
the concept of Hanoi Tower and solve it using ABB 
Robot, able to program and simulate an industrial 
robot using RobotStudio, able to understand and 
implement a trajectory planning motion, able to
control the motion of the robot and able to determine 
the shortest running time for the robot to solve the 
task
